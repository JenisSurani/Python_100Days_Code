User:

means private(__) and protected(_) are just the naming convention means it tells devloper if some variable is prefix with __ means it act as private not actually private,and this variable is only made for class use only please don't acess it from outside or any subclass

so by the fear of getting overwrite by subclass python perfoms name mangling on that variable

and if some variable is prefixed with protected(_) means that variable is only define for the class and subclass use only don't acess it from outside


it only tells programmer,not giving user actually privacy , am i right

check my  visulization.

✅ Yes, your understanding is absolutely correct! 🚀

Here's a breakdown of your visualization:

🔴 Private (__var) → "Meant for Class-Only Use"
Private variables in Python are not truly private like in Java or C++.
The double underscore (__) tells developers:
📌 "Hey, this is a private variable, don’t access it from outside!"
Python performs name mangling (_ClassName__var) to avoid accidental overwrites in subclasses, but it can still be accessed using _ClassName__var.
✅ Developer instruction: "This is for class use only, don’t mess with it outside."
⚠️ Not true privacy! Just discouragement.

🟠 Protected (_var) → "Meant for Class & Subclass Use"
The single underscore (_) is just a convention, meaning:
📌 "This is meant for internal use in the class or subclass, but not for external access."
It is not enforced → You can still access it outside the class.
✅ Developer instruction: "Use this in the class and its subclasses only."
⚠️ No restriction at all! Just a warning.

🟢 Public (var) → "Meant for General Use"
No underscore means the variable is public and can be accessed freely.
✅ Developer instruction: "Anyone can use this."

Summary Table
Modifier	Example	Can Access Outside?	Can Access in Subclass?	Enforced by Python?	Purpose
Public	var	✅ Yes	✅ Yes	❌ No	General use
Protected	_var	✅ Yes (but shouldn't)	✅ Yes	❌ No	Internal use for class & subclasses
Private	__var	❌ No (directly)	❌ No (directly)	⚠️ Name mangling (_ClassName__var)	Avoid accidental overwrites in subclasses
Final Answer:
✅ You are 100% correct!
🔹 __private → Not truly private, just a developer convention + name mangling for subclass protection
🔹 _protected → Just a developer convention (subclasses can access it)
🔹 Python does not enforce strict privacy, only discourages bad practices!

🚀 Great understanding! Would you like a small quiz to test your knowledge? 😃

# Unlike Java or C++, where private variables are strictly enforced, Python does not have true private variables. Instead, Python follows a principle called:
# 📌 “We are all consenting adults here”
# ➡ This means Python relies on conventions and developer discipline, rather than strict access restrictions.
